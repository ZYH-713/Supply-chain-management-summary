# Strategic Presentation (Integrated Recommendations)

## Introduction:

MTC is facing procurement challenges with its medical device supply chain. To address these, we must focus on strategic supplier relationships, cost savings, and operational efficiency. This presentation consolidates key recommendations to enhance procurement performance, focusing on the hospital groups, off-site sterilization, and supplier management.

## 1. Positioning MTC as a Strategic Supplier to Major Hospital Groups:

### Action Steps:
- Develop deep, long-term partnerships with hospital groups, ensuring MTC is seen as an integral partner rather than just a supplier.
- Emphasize value through innovation and reliability in MTC's medical kits.
- Implement joint initiatives for cost optimization, including bulk ordering and custom solutions to meet hospitals' specific needs.
- Focus on aligning MTC’s objectives with the hospital’s quality and sustainability goals.

## 2. Hospital's Considerations for Strategic Partnerships:

### Hospital’s Needs:
- Hospitals are likely to consider cost-effectiveness, reliability, and the ability of suppliers to deliver on time.
- They seek suppliers who can innovate and adapt to their specific requirements (e.g., custom kits, specific equipment).
- Trustworthiness in ensuring quality and regulatory compliance is also essential.
- Collaborative efforts to reduce waste and improve supply chain efficiency will be important to hospitals.

## 3. Collaboration Activities with Hospitals as Strategic Partners:

### Top 3 Activities for Strategic Collaboration:
1. **Joint Procurement Initiatives**: Partner with hospitals to plan and forecast demand, allowing for better inventory management and bulk purchasing.
2. **Customized Solutions**: Work with hospitals to create tailored surgical kits and offer innovative technology that improves patient outcomes and operational efficiency.
3. **Sustainability and Risk Management**: Align on sustainability goals, ensuring environmentally friendly products and practices. Additionally, jointly develop risk mitigation strategies for unforeseen disruptions in the supply chain.

## 4. Analysis of Off-site Sterilization:

### Reasons to Keep Off-site Sterilization:
- **Cost-Effective**: Outsourcing sterilization may reduce MTC's operational costs as it does not require internal resources or infrastructure investment.
- **Expertise and Quality Control**: Specialized third-party service providers are likely to have more expertise in sterilization, ensuring high-quality results.
- **Scalability**: Outsourcing can provide flexibility and scalability, allowing MTC to handle large volumes without the need for additional internal capacity.

### Reasons to Bring Sterilization In-House:
- **Cost Control**: Bringing sterilization in-house would provide better control over costs, particularly in the long run.
- **Faster Turnaround Times**: Internal control could streamline the sterilization process, reducing lead times and improving responsiveness.
- **Quality Assurance**: Direct oversight of the sterilization process ensures higher consistency and quality control.

### Recommendation:
While bringing sterilization in-house provides benefits in terms of cost control and speed, the initial investment in facilities and equipment might be prohibitive. Therefore, a hybrid approach (in-house for critical products and outsourcing for non-critical ones) may be the most balanced solution.

## Conclusion:
By positioning MTC as a strategic partner to major hospital groups, optimizing procurement processes, and considering the right approach to sterilization, MTC can enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and ensure the long-term success of its operations. The integration of strategic supplier relationships and risk management will create a resilient supply chain that can respond effectively to market changes.
